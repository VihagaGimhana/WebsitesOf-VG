    <h1>This is the first experiment</h1>
    <p>In this article, instead of a grammar tip, weâ€™re taking a closer look at a key part of any written text, the paragraph. Paragraphs should be more than just a collection of sentences, but what is the purpose of paragraph structure and how does it impact the paper as a whole?

        Before considering how to structure a paragraph, it is helpful to understand the role that paragraphs play in a manuscript. In the broadest terms, a paragraph presents a complete thought. If a paragraph is written well, its main message can be understood without the need for preceding or following material. Paragraphs that are well designed can help a writer construct an argument in stages and can be thought of as signposts to guide a reader through the argument.</p>
